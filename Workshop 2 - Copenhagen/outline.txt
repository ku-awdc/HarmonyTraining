Improvements:

Explain what a multinomial is start of session 2




Session 1: A practical introduction to MCMC (summary of pre-course work and introduction to the rest of the week)

Didactic:
	- Introduction to teachers
	- Introduction to CA18208
	- Expectations in terms of prior knowledge and programming
	- Bayesian vs Frquentist models for diagnostic test evaluation
	- Introduction to JAGS, demonstration of running simple models
	- Reinforce convergence and effective sample size
	- Plot and summary methods

Exercise:
	- Use JAGS for apparent prevalence model
	
Discussion:
	- Likely to be mostly coding questions

Session 2: Basic Hui-Walter models (the influence of data quantity and priors)

Didactic:
	- Paired tests where neither is perfect
	- One population
	- Label switching, convergence
	- Introduction to simulating data to check model function

Exercise:
	- Simulate data from one population and analyse

Discussion:
	- 

Session 3: Multi-population Hui-Walter models (how and why to select different populations)

Didactic:
	- Adaptation of

Multiple populations when Se and Sp are not constant - Toft paper to illustrate when it goes wrong


Session 4: Multi-test, multi-population models (correlation between tests)

Session 5: How to interpret the latent class (a practical exploration of test correlations)

Mostly discussion

Session 6: Coping with missing data

Standard test for surveillance, then add research test for some animals, different tests present in different populations
Passive surveillance data vs prospective studies
Combined test for screening

Example from Lef+Polychronis:  penis samples vs milk samples - MAR?


Session 7: Incorporating imperfect sensitivity and specificity into more complex models (adapting generalised linear models)

Look for published examples
Simulated data:
	- One test - ok to use LR
	- Two tests with different characteristics (PCR vs Antigen)

Session 8: Working on participantsâ€™ own data

New microphone

12 next Friday
